/* Mini forth interpreter based on eForth with simplifications

   Overview
   ========
   This is a forth interpreter inspired by eForth, with simplifications.
   Its goal is to be as compact as possible so it's possible to assemble itself from Forth.
   The following simplifications have be made with respect to the usual eForth implementations:
   Memory map simplifications: just a 1K param stack, and a RAM zone with dic and data
     growing from the low addresses and the return stack growing from the high addresses
   No USER pointer, only one user is supported
   Only a single word list, no vocabularies for each user.
   Favor F2012 words and semantics over the older standards if different.
   
   Builtin words are stored in RODATA. They cant be changed, but can be
   overriden by user entries.
   
   Hardware Registers
   ------------------

   The forth interpreter uses registers for its internal use.
   SP is used as parameter stack pointer.
   Y  is used as return stack pointer.
   X and D can be used for calculations.

   Data structures
   ===============

   Interpreter variables
   ---------------------
   
   The state of the interpreter is described in several variables, stored in the internal HC11 RAM.
   Here is a description of what each variable does.
   IP   - The instruction pointer. Points to the next instruction to execute.
   HERE - pointer to the next free byte in the Data Space
   LAST - pointer to the last definition. Initialized to the last builtin word definition.
   BEHA - pointer containing the word routine that will manage the parsed tokens. Either INTERP or COMPILE.
          This word routine is called with a word pointer on the parameter stack.
          BEHA is changed to EXECUTE when executing the immediate word [
          BEHA is changed to COMPILE when executing the immediate word ]
          COMPILE appends the word pointer on the parameter stack to the current definition
          EXECUTE executes the word by "calling" it.
   BASE - Contains the value of the current number conversion base (unused now)
   
   Dictionary and Data space
   -------------------------

   The data space is used to store new word definitions and user data structures.
   It grows from low addresses (0100h) to upper addresses in the external memory.

   User definitions are allocated in the data space. The definitions are added
   one after the other, linking the new one to the previous one. The pointer to
   the last definition is maintained in LAST. This pointer is initialized to the
   last entry in the builtin dictionary.

   Dictionary entry
   ----------------

   Each entry has the following structure:
   2 bytes: pointer to previous entry
   N bytes: the word itself, NULL terminated. Only ASCII values 32-127 are allowed.
   1 byte:  flags. It seems that we need 2 flags:
            - immediate: word has to be executed even while compiling.
            - compile only: word cannot be executed (control structures?).
   (NOTE: to save one byte per word, the flags can be set in the terminator itself
   if the name is terminated by a byte having the most significant bit set instead of zero.)
   The 3 previous bytes form the word header. It is only inspected when searching for words.
   2 bytes: code pointer (ITC) - address of native code that implements this routine. Special value ENTER
            is used to handle compiled forth definitions.
   A forth word pointer, as used in user definitions, is a pointer to the code pointer for the word.
   
   Parameter stack
   ---------------
   The parameter stack is used to store temporary data items. It shoud not grow
   to an extremely large value, so it size is fixed when the interpreter is
   initialized.
   The stack grows down, it starts at the end of the RAM, and the storage
   PUSH is post-decrement, push LSB first.
   POP  is pre-increment, pull MSB first.
   The stack pointer always point at the next free location in the stack.
   For the moment underflow and overflows are not detected.

   Return stack
   ------------
   The return stack is used to push return addresses when nesting word
   executions. It is also used to manage control flow structures. Since this
   space is used a lot by complex programs, it is expected that limiting its
   size might prevent large programs from executing. Its size is only limited
   by the growth of the data space. It is initialized just below the maximum
   span of the parameter stack (7C00), and it can grows down until the return stack
   pointer hits HERE.
   
   To push to the return stack, we store at 0,Y then dey dey (post-decrement)
   To pop from return stack, we increment Y by 2 with ldab #2 aby then load at 0,y (pre-increment)
   For the moment underflow and overflows are not detected.

   Interpreter
   -----------
   The intepreter receives chars from the input device until an end of line is
   reached. The compiler is then executed, which translates input to an unnamed
   word. The unnamed word is then executed.

   Compilation
   -----------
   Each word is recognized and replaced by the address of its code pointer.
   Note this is not the address of the definition but the code pointer itself.
   The last code pointer entry of a compiled word is a RETURN, which pops an
   address from the return stack and use it as new instruction pointer.

   The compiler uses all the CPU registers, so the previous contents of the
   forth registers is saved before compilation and restored after.
